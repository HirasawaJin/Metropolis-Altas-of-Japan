# Metropolis-Atlas-of-Japan
This is a project working on creating Metroplis Atlas of Japan.
The idea whas inspired by this book.

"Africa's Urbanisation Dynamics 2020 - Africapolis, Mapping a New Urban Geography"

Since I am a totaly newbie to programming and Github, I don't even know the right way to use this thing.

All data we need come from here.
E-Stat.GOV.JP
https://www.e-stat.go.jp/gis/statmap-search?page=1&type=1&toukeiCode=00200521

The code itself is very simple. 
No Machine Leaning or things like that.
Just some simple algorithm and Boolean.

I will explain more when I know more about how to use Github.

This is the result of top 76 Metropolis(population above 100,000 ppl) of Japan.

Part 8 of the Program is to convert the data into csv that can be linked with original border data from E-Stat.GOV.JP. 
So that you can view the result in GIS.
